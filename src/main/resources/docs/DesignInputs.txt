Design Considerations

-->Fake Weather Data Generation with consideration of atmosphere,
 topography, geography,oceanography, or similar
-->Documentation
-->TestCases

use seperate class for each element ( topography, geography )
Use trait to define such element
Use configuration file to configure bounds for temperature etc
Make it reusable to generate realworld data
Use class level documentation  to make it more readable
Pass parameters to define how the data to be generated eg: number of records, number of stations, period , dataset size etc;

Questions

--> Input to progam would be a file with list of locations/weather stations (eg: SYDNEY )and the program will generate fake weather data
for them for the configured duration with a gap of configured period.
--> I believe I dont have to hit any external weather APIs to generate data, as I understand it is fake/simulated data with
close resemblance to plausible data
